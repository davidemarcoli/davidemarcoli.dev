      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Architecture Overview</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The library is built on Stencil, a compiler that generates standards-compliant
        Web Components. This ensures that the components are lightweight, fast, and
        compatible across modern browsers.
        <br />
        For each supported framework (React, Angular, Vue), there are dedicated
        wrapper packages that make integration seamless. The core component library is
        maintained separately, allowing for independent updates and enhancements.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The SIX Web Components library empowers teams to maintain a consistent
        design system across multiple applications and frameworks. Its open-source
        nature invites internal and external contributions, fostering innovation
        and quality. Built with performance and clarity in mind, it&apos;s a powerful tool
        for building trustworthy, enterprise-grade user interfaces.
